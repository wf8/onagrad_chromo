# marginal likelihoods: observed data

dependent: -2108.13
independent: -2118.74

ln(BF) = K = -2108.13 - -2118.74 = 10.61
BF = e^K = 40538 
decisive support for dependent model (Jeffreys 1961)

# marginal likelihoods: simulated data rep 1
# rate = 5 expected events

dependent: -2031.85
independent: -2034.95

ln(BF) = K = -2031.85 - -2034.95 = 3.1
BF = e^K = 22.2
strong suppor for dependent.....
